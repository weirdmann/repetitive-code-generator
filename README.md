# repetitive code generator

To be fair, I don't know many uses of this tool but for me it is so useful to be able to quickly generate many repetitions of the same code with just a few numbers changed in them.
This might be seen as something you never should have to do and a really bad programming practice. I work with Programmable Logic Controllers, Siemens's mainly. There, you can't always use for loop to iterate over many instances of the same code.
Not every data type can conveniently be put into an array.
